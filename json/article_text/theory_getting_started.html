<h3>Software</h3>
<p>
    To get started with the music theory tutorials on this website, I recommend that you download a few programs on your computer.
    This will make music production much easier- the composition and recording process can be done much quicker on a computer.
    I recommend that you install a music notation program and a digital audio workstation. Some free examples I recommend are 
    <a href='https://musescore.org/'>MuseScore</a> and <a href='https://www.lmms.io'>LMMS</a>. (I am not affiliated with any of these 
    projects or their owners/maintainers in any way. These links are provided for your convenience.)

<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>

    When creating compositions where music theory is used heavily, it is wise to first create a score, export it as a MIDI file, and
    import it into your digital audio workstation of choice. Music theory concepts are easier to apply to scores rather than a piano roll in
    a digital audio workstation because in a score, much more information is visible.

<h3>Further Notes</h3>
<p>
    These tutorials will not post specific details on using these programs themselves, but rather general concepts that one can use
    for using these kinds of software in music production. This is so that articles may be concise with only relevant details only, which
    can be applied to a variety of environments. If you find yourself stuck on navigating your software of choice, I recommend using that
    software's documentation or other online tutorials dedicated specifically towards using that piece of software.
