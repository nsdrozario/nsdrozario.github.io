    Chords are extremely important for music composition. Chords can influence the mood of a song greatly, so using 
    the right chords is extremely important.

    Harmony
</h3>
<p>
    Chords are fundemental in establishing harmony between voices. This is because certain chords accomplish certain musical functions. 
    This concept is the core of <span style="font-weight: bold;">functional harmony</span>. However, before using functional harmony to 
    decide what chords to use, one must identify or decide the key of the piece. This is because the chords are built upon the tones of the 
    current key (with some exceptions). For example, here are the chords for the key of A Major:
</p>
<img src="img/chords_AMaj.png" alt="Chords: A, Bmin, C#min, D, E, F#min, G#dim, A" />
<p>
    Note how all of the notes of the chords are built upon tones within the key, and not outside the key.
    The Roman numerals denote the relationship of the chord relative to the tonic. When the numerals are capitalized, a major chord is denoted;
    in lowercase, a minor chord is denoted. These Roman numeral names for the chords are used so that they can be applied to any
    tonic note.

    These chords share the names of their root note names as well, as shown in the table below, in the key of A Major:
