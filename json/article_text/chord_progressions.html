Now, we can use chords to define the motion and structure of our piece or song. We do this by using <span style="bold">chord progressions</span>.
Chord progressions are simply a sequence of chords. When a piece is said to follow a chord progression, it means that the notes that are played across all voices
reflect the chords that are played in the chord progression in question.

Refer back to the previous article's tutorial about chords. With chord progressions, we refer to the chords used by their roman numeral name relative to the current key, so that 
the names of the chords in the chord progression reflect their purpose in the progression, not their actual identity. This is helpful because then the progression can be interpreted the 
same way for multiple keys.

A chord progression often used in popular music is I-V-vi-IV. Note that the numerals must be uppercase to reflect a major chord and lowercase to reflect a minor chord.
In the key of C Major, the chord progression listed above maps to CMaj-GMaj-Amin-FMaj.
